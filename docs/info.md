## How it works

The design implements a **stream-oriented SHA-256 processor** completely in synthesizable Verilog.  It is split into two cooperating blocks:

1. **`sha256_core`** – Performs the 64 compression rounds for a single 512-bit message block.  It contains the full message-schedule RAM, the 64 K-constants, and a small state-machine (IDLE → PREP → COMP → DONE).  A new 32-bit word is calculated every clock so one block is processed in **64 cycles**.
2. **`sha256_processor`** – Wraps the core with logic that
   • buffers incoming bytes into 512-bit blocks,
   • adds the mandatory SHA-256 padding (0x80 + zeros + 64-bit length),
   • chains the intermediate hash values, and
   • presents the final 256-bit digest.
   
   Because the padding engine is built-in, **messages of any length** may be streamed in **a single pass** – no pre-counting of the message length is required on the host side.

### UART front-end

For easy interaction the project also includes **`top_uart_sha256`** which connects the processor to a 115 200 baud UART:

• `ui_in[3]` – RX (input to the chip)  
• `uo_out[4]` – TX (output from the chip)

Protocol:

1. Host sends **0x01** to indicate *start of a new message*.
2. Stream the message bytes (any length ≥ 0).
3. Send a single **0xFF** byte to mark *end of message* – the processor starts hashing immediately.
4. When ready the core returns **64 ASCII hexadecimal characters** (most-significant nibble first) representing the 256-bit digest.

The TX line stays idle while the hash is calculated (64 + overhead cycles per 512-bit block), then the ASCII result is streamed back.

### Timing & area

Running at 50 MHz a 1-block message is processed in ≈ 1 µs (64 cycles for the core + control overhead).  Longer messages add 64 cycles per additional block.  The design fits comfortably in Tiny Tapeout's area budget.

## How to test

### RTL simulation

From the `test/` directory:
```sh
cd test
make -B         # runs cocotb against the RTL sources
```
The supplied `test.py` can be extended to feed a sample string and compare the returned digest with Python's `hashlib.sha256()`.

### FPGA / Tiny Tapeout silicon

1. Connect a 3.3 V USB-UART adapter:
   • Adapter TX → `ui_in[3]` (chip RX)  
   • Adapter RX → `uo_out[4]` (chip TX)  
   • GND common
2. Power the board and run a terminal at **115 200 8-N-1**.
3. Example session (host side):
   ```python
   import serial, hashlib
   msg = b"hello world"                    # test message
   ser = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 115200)
   ser.write(b'\x01' + msg + b'\xFF')      # protocol framing
   digest_ascii = ser.read(64)              # blocking read
   print(digest_ascii.decode())             # 64 hex chars
   assert digest_ascii == hashlib.sha256(msg).hexdigest().encode()
   ```

## External hardware

No special peripherals are required – just a **USB-UART dongle** (3.3 V level) and a 50 MHz clock provided by the Tiny Tapeout infrastructure.  A status LED can optionally be wired to `uo_out[4]` to observe TX activity.
